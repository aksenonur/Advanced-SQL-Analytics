-- 1. Sales Performance & Cumulative Revenue Analysis (Window Functions)
-- Calculates running totals and moving averages across orders.
SELECT

    AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg_amount
FROM 
    orders;

-- 2. Customer Segmentation via RFM-Style CTE (Common Table Expressions)
-- Categorizes customers based on purchase frequency and total spending volume.

-- 3. Performance Optimization: Strategic Indexing
-- Creating composite indexes to eliminate full table scans on high-frequency filters.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_customer_date 
ON orders (customer_id, order_date DESC);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_amount 
ON orders (amount);
